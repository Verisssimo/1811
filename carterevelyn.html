            <div class="document">
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Evelyn Margareth Carter.</p>
                <p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> January 15, 1780</p>
                <p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Advanced Researcher in Subatomic Matter.</p>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong >Portland, Oregon.</p>
                <p><strong>Government Information:</strong> Evelyn Carter was a brilliant yet cautious woman. She was extremely dedicated to science, but over time, she developed a growing concern about the government's motivations and the potential risks that the experiments posed to humanity.</p>
                <p>Her colleagues described her as discreet, yet with an insatiable curiosity, always exploring the depths of the unknown. Her last notes found in her laboratory suggest that she was on the verge of making a crucial discovery about the antineutrino and even about Hartmann's whereabouts.</p>
                <p>Her relationship with Dr. Hartmann was one of deep respect and even admiration, but in the months leading up to his disappearance, she began to question whether they were truly in control of what they were creating.</p>
                <p><strong>Death:</strong> Her death was reported after the massive explosion at the Oregon laboratory, which involved research across various fields of science. Although her body was never found, experts and records confirm that Evelyn was present on the day of the incident with her team, following a long day of work.</p>

                <p><strong>Document:</strong> Personal Diary.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Fragments of an old personal diary belonging to Evelyn were found in the wreckage of the laboratory, where she kept all her notes on the antineutrino. According to rumors, after Hartmann's possible death, she allegedly met with the Consortium to construct a second prototype of the Beetle, as she had recorded confidential information, fearing that the project of her life might somehow be stolen or fail.</p>
