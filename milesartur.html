            <div class="document">
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Artur Edmund Miles.</p>
                <p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> April 29, 1783</p>
                <p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Advanced Particle Researcher and Chemist.</p>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong >Portland, Oregon.</p>
                <p><strong>Government Information:</strong> Artur was a man of moderate and balanced nature, with his mind focused on the safety and precision of experiments. Although he respected Hartmann's ambition, he approached projects with much more caution, often expressing concerns about the direction they were taking.</p>
                <p>His loyalty to the government was unwavering. Especially after the explosion, the government faked his death so that, at his request, he could live a quiet life somewhere in South America. This change transformed him from a confident scientist into a solitary and reflective individual.</p>
                <p>In the Nimbus project, Artur's role was to develop efficient methods for stabilizing and capturing the antineutrino, minimizing significant losses. His contributions were essential for the development of the first prototype. He was one of the first to join Hartmann's team and fought for him until the very end.</p>
                <p><strong>Death:</strong> No information about his death. After his move to the south, he became undetectable, and the witness protection program stopped providing updates about him after a few years of isolation.</p>
