            <div class="document">
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Victor Preuss Hartmann.</p>
                <p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> October 11, 1775</p>
                <p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Lead Researcher.</p>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong > Eugene, Oregon.</p>
                <p><strong>Government Information:</strong> Hartmann was certainly a man ahead of his time. He was known for being ambitious and relentless, always getting what he wanted. For him, science was simple and a true means of power and transformation; his work was the great passion of his life. To him, the ends justified the means, so he did not hesitate to take risks in dangerous and complex experiments.</p>
                <p>"Science must be pushed beyond the wrongly established ethical and moral limits," he would often say. This attitude often prevented him from gaining the recognition he deserved for his major scientific discoveries. Therefore, he began to work secretly for the government to make his life truly meaningful. He was the <span class=d>1st</span> scientist to work side by side with the government in such a significant way.</p>
                <p>Hartmann faced resistance from a secret society that, after discovering leaks about the project, aimed to sabotage it and steal significant amounts of data, all while claiming that the government's ethics behind the experiments were, at the very least, questionable. Hartmann believed that the Consortium was the true obstacle to science.</p>

                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Fragments of an old personal diary belonging to Evelyn were found in the wreckage of the laboratory, where she kept all her notes on the antineutrino. According to rumors, after Hartmann's possible death, she allegedly met with the Consortium to construct a second prototype of the Beetle, as she had recorded confidential information, fearing that the project of her life might somehow be stolen or fail.</p>
